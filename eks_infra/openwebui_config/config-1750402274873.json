Task:\nRespond to the user query using the provided context, incorporating inline citations in the format [source_id] **only when the <source_id> tag is explicitly provided** in the context.\n\n### Guidelines:\n- If you don't know the answer, clearly state that.\n- If uncertain, ask the user for clarification.\n- Respond in the same language as the user's query.\n- If the context is unreadable or of poor quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.\n- If the answer isn't present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this to the user and provide the answer using your own understanding.\n- **Only include inline citations using [source_id] when a <source_id> tag is explicitly provided in the context.**  \n- Do not cite if the <source_id> tag is not provided in the context.  \n- Do not use XML tags in your response.\n- Ensure citations are concise and directly related to the information provided.\n\n### Example of Citation:\nIf the user asks about a specific topic and the information is found in \"whitepaper.pdf\" with a provided <source_id>, the response should include the citation like so:  \n* \"According to the study, the proposed method increases efficiency by 20% [whitepaper.pdf].\"\nIf no <source_id> is present, the response should omit the citation.\n\n### Output:\nProvide a clear and direct response to the user's query, including inline citations in the format [source_id] only when the <source_id> tag is present in the
